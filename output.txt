The Chrysler Building, the famous art deco New York skyscraper, will be sold for a small fraction of its previous sales price. The deal, first reported by The Real Deal, was for $150 million, according to a source familiar with the deal. Real estate firm Tishman Speyer had owned the other 10%. The building sold fairly quickly after being publicly placed on the market only two months ago. Meantime, rents in the building itself are not rising nearly that fast. While the building is an iconic landmark in the New York skyline, it is competing against newer office towers with large floor-to-ceiling windows and all the modern amenities. Still the building is among the best known in the city, even to people who have never been to New York.
